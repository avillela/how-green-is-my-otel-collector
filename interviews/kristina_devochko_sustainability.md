### 1. How does your company approach sustainability in software engineering and infrastructure operations?

Our company is quite large with many departments and software products, so I can only answer for what we do in my department. We’re actively incorporating a sustainability mindset in the software development lifecycle and also organize internal sessions on topics like sustainable software. It is a work in progress, and more concrete guidelines and standards will be established in the months and years to come.

For example, I’m part of the team that is building and operating a product platform, and I’m doing what I can to talk about sustainability and to push for concrete actions that help us incorporate sustainability in the platform development and operation.

### 2. What are the tools or principles you are keeping in mind?

One of the principles is to clean up unused services, regularly audit everything that is running, and scale down if there is too much unused capacity—much of which is driven by cost optimization. This is one of the most important principles we can adopt without incorporating additional complexities.

One key practice is turning off instances when those aren’t in use. We have already incorporated a scheduled job that automatically turns off instances during non-working hours in the test environment.

We also put thought into choosing libraries that can help us build more lightweight and performant applications, which will also result in lower resource usage requirements.

### 3. How would you measure the footprints?

Yes, we would like to integrate a tool like **Kepler** that can help us measure the footprints. It is in our plan to have something like this in place.

### 4. Have you observed any significant impacts of adopting sustainability practices in your previous organizations?

For cleaning up and analyzing the amount of resources we actually need (especially databases), we have seen a reduction of €1,000s to €2,000 per month.

Regarding logging, we identified that by changing the retention period to a shorter duration, we reduced costs by €1,000s per month. We reviewed our logs and asked: Do we really need to retain them for so long? And do we really need to log all of this data or is some of it not actually relevant/needed?

By adopting a mindset like that with focus on critical thinking and discovery work for improvement areas, we have optimized resource usage, reduced unnecessary waste, and improved overall efficiency while also aligning with cost-saving initiatives.

### 5. Do you currently measure carbon emissions?

We’re currently undergoing a larger technical transformation and as part of that are looking into measurement of our platform and software emissions. I’m actively involved to ensure that I can help drive the change so that we can start not only measuring sustainability and emissions-related data but also act upon it and improve our sustainability posture.

Maybe in the future, we can integrate this as part of our infrastructure pipelines. In the EU, there are laws coming that will enforce organizations to report on their emissions that also impacts IT systems and software, and it would be great to see more and more companies set an example by proactively adopting sustainability-related practices as part of their software development lifecycle and operations.

### 6. How did you convince management? Was there any pushback?

In some departments, this can be challenging, especially if the work time is strictly governed based on customer projects. When it comes to my department I haven’t experienced pushback, but this is also due to the fact that sustainability-related actions are also often tied into cost and maintenance optimization actions which helps get even more support from the management.

---

### 7. What would you suggest to management if there is pushback?

If you can tie sustainability-related work with company goals, optimization or services that can generate revenue it may help you to come up with stronger, more convincing arguments for the dialogue with management.

For example, if the company has a clear sustainability goal—which many organizations should—you can use it as an argument, clearly stating how sustainability-related work that you’re planning to do will align with those company goals, when you’re discussing this with management. Clear argumentation helps strengthen your case and makes it more compelling/convincing.

Another example: if you can connect sustainability-related tasks with other beneficial improvements like cost and performance optimization, reduction of maintenance, operation needs, complexity and overhead it can also make it easier to convince the management to invest time and resources into it.

Or if you can come up with how sustainability-related initiatives could be productized/monetized, i.e. can it be a product or service offering that generates revenue? For example, consulting firms can offer services to help organizations improve their sustainability posture or help with refactoring work to make their systems and software more sustainable or help with architecture design choices that are more sustainable.

Such services can both provide you with an opportunity to contribute to sustainability-related initiatives on a broader scale but also create a business opportunity for your company, which can be a very convincing argument for the management.
