### What role does PTC play in advancing sustainability within the tech and manufacturing sectors?

Through product sustainability, PTC can help discrete manufacturing companies reduce their footprints. Within PTC's software we have both partnered with expert companies and created in-house sustainable solutions that help support the full lifecycle of a manufactured product—from ideation to manufacturing, through product use and service—helping to understand not only the implications of a manufactured product on the environment but the use and end of life of the product as well.

### Why should companies prioritize sustainability in their digital transformation strategy?

Sustainability is becoming an increasingly relevant topic for many large businesses due to regulations in the EU that may require companies to report their carbon footprint. But in order to properly track footprints, companies need technology and software tools that will help collect accurate product data and aid in making sustainable decisions early in the design phase.

For designers and manufacturers, the earlier a product change is made, the more cost-efficient it is—and having the proper technology to support sustainable decision-making early on helps support this.

### Why should companies see sustainability as a value driver rather than just a compliance requirement?

Not only is sustainability the right thing to do for the environment, but it is the right thing to do in a business sense. Reducing carbon footprints is not a sunk cost but can actually help companies reduce expenses.

Many times, reducing the carbon footprint of a product will go hand in hand with cutting costs—whether it be through recycling, lightweighting, or scrap avoidance. All of these save cost and support sustainability.

### How is PTC enabling organizations to measure and reduce their carbon footprint through technology?

Through our own software and partners, PTC helps to enable customers to:
- Pinpoint highest carbon costs
- Provide material databases for potential green solutions
- Support modular design
- Provide insights on how to reduce carbon impacts in manufacturing, and more.

### How can organizations embed sustainability into their software and infrastructure operations from day one?

Embedding sustainability into organizational operations early on is much more efficient than tacking it on later. Starting with quick wins that reduce both footprint and costs—such as reducing unnecessary floor space or encouraging green commuter benefits—can be a great place to start.

Learning about **Design for Sustainability** and **lifecycle thinking** is a great way to begin the journey on sustainable products and business practices. Organizations can also choose reliable and green suppliers, not only for operations but also for infrastructure, as a good initiative from day one that can help reduce both cost and footprint.

### How can tech teams and employees drive sustainability initiatives within their organizations, even if leadership isn’t fully committed yet?

Employees can drive sustainability initiatives within their organizations through grassroots efforts by building a group of like-minded individuals who have the passion to take on projects within the company together.

Little projects and movements go a long way. The more employees can foster a community and culture of green within the company, the more likely it will become a value to the entire organization.

At PTC, we have an employee-led group called **Green@PTC**, which started by taking charge of small environmentally focused activities like setting up recycling programs and battery drives, but has grown to be involved with supporting decarbonization projects and other environmental improvements across our organization.
